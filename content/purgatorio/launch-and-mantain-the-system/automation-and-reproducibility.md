## Advantages of Automation and The Need for Reproducibility

All the previous guides within Purgatorio suggest various things:

- there are _many steps_ to be taken to start from the raw data and get to high-performance models 
- you can make a lot of _mistakes_ and various kinds of mistakes.
- many steps can be _tedious or boring_ to repeat manually (Data Cleaning, I'm watching you).

So, how can we simplify our work and become more productive, decrease the likelihood of making mistakes, and make our work repeatable? 

The keyword is one: [Automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation). 

Automation is the best solution to all the problems mentioned above, and also saves us time! 

This is true for almost every field (not only Data Science), in fact if we look at the Wikipedia definition it says: 

> _Advantages of Automation_:
>
>- Increased throughput or productivity.
>- Improved quality or increased predictability of quality.
>- Improved robustness (consistency), of processes or product.
>- Increased consistency of output.
>- Reduced direct human labor costs and expenses.
>- Replaces human operators in tasks that involve hard physical or monotonous work (e.g., using 
>- Performs tasks that are beyond human capabilities of size, weight, speed, endurance, etc.
>- Reduces operation time and work handling time significantly.
>- Frees up workers to take on other roles.
>- Provides higher level jobs in the development, deployment, maintenance and running of the automated processes.

This article explains very well why Automation is crucial for the Data Science world:

### Disadvantages of Automation

Some might argue that Automation has not only advantages, but also disadvantages, such as job losses (it takes less human to do the same things).

This argument goes beyond the technical issue of how to improve the Data Science process, so it will not be covered in this guide. 

However, this topic has valid counter-arguments, if you want to know more read here:

So, we can state that Automation is crucial for the Data Science process to become useful, for a variety of reasons. But perhaps the most important reason, when it comes to automation in science, is the [**Reproducibility**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) issue. 

**Data Science, precisely, is a "Science", in the sense that it must be demonstrable and reproducible!**

::: warning
Without Reproducibility, without the support of the repeatability of experiments, any result of Data Science is useless (or even harmful, because it reinforces human bias).
