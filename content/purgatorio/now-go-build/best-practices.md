The purpose of this guide is not so much to collect every existing best practice in Data Science (a very difficult task) but rather to give you the method by which to look for new best practices and put them into practice.  

However, a number of resources are listed that should be more than sufficient to develop advanced and robust practices for your Data Science projects. 

## The Mutant Runner

Exploring the Purgatorio, you've encountered a lot of links and websites that list good practices for Data Science, but it happens that those lists can be either contradictory or incomplete.

Why is it so difficult to build good and consistent practices for Data Science?
